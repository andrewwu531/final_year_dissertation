Project Specification

Project Significance (Done2) 

Following the covid-19 pandemic, restaurant owners are facing an uphill battle against the prospect of their future financial success. The skyrocket global unemployment rate has led to rising anxiety amongst individuals to spend money in restaurants. Furthermore, we are likely to observe a decline in the supply of waitering jobs given the uprising number of University graduates every year and the aging developed countries. To support restaurant owners through this difficult time, an interesting software project – Hi, i-Waiter! – has been pioneered, a web-based platform that primarily takes orders and payments for restaurant customers. 

Project Objectives & Market Competitiveness (Done2)

To introduce the full scope of the project, we cluster the software components into portions that must be done, the minimal viable product; and those that will be done after the project, the future work. 

Minimal Viable Product (Done2)

First, we will examine the minimal deliverables that must be completed before the end of the project in March 2021, in terms of the restaurant owners, customers, chef and waiter. 


1.	Restaurant Owners

a.	Lowers Staff Costs by £10,000 - £30,000+

The power of this software system is its dramatic capacity to minimise waitering workload by at least 50%, and consequently half the staff costs. Upon subscribing and adapting fully to the platform, restaurant waitering staff will no longer need to take orders, register meal details to the computer system, take any bills and tips from the customers and send any orders to the kitchen. They only need to serve the food from the kitchen to the table. The £10,000 - £30,000+ figure is derived based on annual minimum wage of a waiter. It is £8 per hour x 8 hours x 6 days x 50 weeks = £19,200 = £20,000. Let’s assume that a medium sized restaurant has 3 serving staffs. If less a staff is needed, then we can conclude that the medium sized restaurant owner can earn an upward £20,000 a year.


2.	Restaurant Customers 

a.	Faster Meal Ordering and Payment

For our restaurant customers, they will enjoy immensely the immediate food and drink ordering. They no longer need to patiently wait for staff to come in, take their orders and put it into the computer system. 


















Future Work (Done2)

This section encompasses the non-essential requirements of the project in the perspectives of the restaurant owners and their customers. 

1.	Restaurant Owners 

a.	Reduce Table Reservation Fee by £1,800

Restaurant owners are currently facing hefty fees from online table reservation system. A populous website, OpenTable.com (2010) is charging an enormous £1 per seated person. If we modestly assume that there will be 6 customers reserving their tables via the platform each day, the restaurant will subject to the cost of 6 customers a day x £1 per customer x 6 days x 50 weeks = £1,800 annually. Adopting us as the alternative platform, they will save a tremendous £1,800 each year. We are able to offer this level of service because our main objective is to enhance tractions from the restaurant owners via our ordering platform. 










b.	Reduce Advertisement Cost by £240

We also take advertisement interests into our hearts. Advertisement is undisputedly the bridge between restaurants and potential customers. However, 5pm.com (2020) currently charges £200 + VAT annual fee for their platform advertisement and electronics reservation system. Comparatively, OpenTable (2010) also charges £199 monthly subscription fee for the same service. We want to offer our clients free advertisement service and save them at least £240 a year. This is to attract restaurant owners to use our robot waiter app.

c.	Free Table Management Software 

Successful restaurants usually incorporate intelligent table management system, especially for high yield restaurants in which they face the constant challenge of efficient seat allocation. Restaurant staffs may not be able to glance the restaurant for empty tables and it is a time cost to walk around the restaurant and see whether there is an empty and unreserved table. Consequently, we will establish a platform for restaurant staffs to record the status of each table – occupied or empty – to accommodate the fast-pace change in restaurant operations. 



d.	Free Staff Rota Software

Experienced restaurant owners will often encounter headaches when writing their staff rota sheet. They need to ask for staff availability and allocate shifts in a way that reflects the demands of many restaurant staffs. As a result, we are passionate to develop an electronic staff rota system to reduce the cumbersome and time-consuming natures of paper rotas. 


e.	Competitive Accountant & Insurance Rates 

As a platform dependent software, we will uniquely attract high volume of online traffics from both the restaurant owners and their customers. We will be able to offer large scale accounting and insurance services via our personalised payment portal. The unique standpoint for this strategy is that it is far most cost-effective to conduct tax and accountant consultant via pre-recorded YouTube videos through hyperlinks from emails/ posts with the quantity of restaurant owner clients that we will acquire. 










2.	Restaurant Customers

a.	Search for Other Restaurants

Another distinct advantage of high quantity traffics is the fact that we can branch out our types of services easily. We want to establish a web-based find-restaurant website that collects all the restaurants in the world. We believe we have a competitive edge over other existing platforms because we can redirect restaurant customers to the find-restaurant page after the payment process. We will display all the restaurants in the city based on proximity and popularity. 



b.	Search for Nearby Events/ Activities 

Event/ Activity Hosting is another segment we want to target. We will be a platform that enables registered users to advertise their local activities. With an established pool of users from the food ordering platform, it should be an easier task for us to re-direct and advertise our own product, e.g. after food payment. 








Software Marketing (Done)

1.	Email Crawler & Post
To advertise our products, several marketing strategies have been considered. They are the Email Crawler and Post. The idea is that we use Information Retrieval System to collect the restaurant names, addresses, emails, and telephone numbers based on the Restaurant and the Location keywords. For example, we can use the keywords Restaurant and Glasgow to automatically find relevant restaurant websites and push all these data to our database. Then, we can automatically write a high volume of emails and later on posts to these restaurants. 

2.	YouTube Tutorial Videos 
The restaurant owners can then click the link in the email/ keywords in the post and follow the YouTube instructions in the email/ post and start adding their details using our app. Alternatively, they can call or email us to inform us their data and we will start an account for them. We will ask them either upload all the data themselves or upload a menu so we can add the text for them. Now, please go to appendix 1 to see an example of emails and posts we will send them.

3.	Search Engine Optimisation 
We will also implement SEO system, so our website appears first in the search results.

User Story Workshop 





Detailed Project Conceptual Analysis (Done)

1.	Customer’s Greeting 
First, we have a group of customers waiting at the entrance of a restaurant. Using our app, A waiter will confirm whether they have reservations. If they have a reservation, the staff will take the customers to a reserved table. If they don’t have a reservation, the staff will check whether there is an empty table in the restaurant. If there isn’t, the staff will ask them to reserve a table for later on sit-in. If there is, the staff will walk them to the table, sit them and explain them the new app. The waiter may say “Hi, there. We are using this new meal ordering app! If you can take out your phone and scan the QR code with the camera, you will be able to use the app!”

2.	QR Code 
Now, the customers will scan the QR code sticker on the middle of the table and their phone will be redirected to our login page. We want to use a web platform instead of a mobile app because Apple is currently charging 30% of revenue for apps that are displayed in the Apple App Store. Web Development are for *** per month. The QR code will be in the form of location-postcode-ID-table-number. This is to uniquely identify the order. An example of QR code reference is GL-G128QQ-0001-1.  

3.	Login Page
We want to use a login page because we want to record consumer’s behaviours for advertising purposes. We will have Facebook Login, Instagram Login, Microsoft Email Login and the normal email address and password login. 



4.	Meal Ordering Platform 
Now, the customers can see the image, textual description and price of the meals in current time. Meals are different when it is in the morning, afternoon, and evening. We also enable food and drinks to be clustered by the category of food. A possible category is non-alcoholic, alcoholic, starters, main course, and dessert. They just need to select the food and drinks that they like. This will be guided by a 1 second animated video. Once they finish the ordering, they can click the bill icon for the bill summary.

5.	Bill Summary & Payment Portal 
They will now be able to see the summary of food and drinks that they have ordered. Once the customers confirm that the bill summary is correct, they will either enter their card details (card number, expiry date and security code) or click pay by cash. They can also add tips to the payment. For repeating customers, their card details will be recorded into the system. They just need to enter the CCV code. Once the button order is clicked, the request will then be sent to the kitchen. The customer will be redirected to our “Other Apps” section whereby we promote our partner apps so they can advertise us as well. We will ask the users the ratings and feedbacks of the past restaurants they have been. This data will help the system to recommend users the restaurants they may want to go next time. After that, they will be redirected to our “Restaurant Look-Up” section where all the nearby and recommended restaurants will be displayed. 

6.	Restaurant Kitchen Receiving an Order
Now, the chef will see the bill summary and will cook the food for them. 

7.	Staff Bringing Out Meals
Once the food is ready, the staff will bring out the food to the customers. When they have finished the meal, they can leave the restaurant. If they needed to pay their bills by cash, a staff will approach the customers and take the bill payment.  



















Annual Revenue Estimation (Done)

If we can help business owners to save £10,000 - £30,000 + as indicated in the Section Project Objectives and Market Competitiveness, it would be a reasonable step for us to charge around £2,500 for every £10,000 saving. 

Now, let’s consider the profit made by a medium sized restaurant which has 3 staffs. It will have around 50 customers x 2.5 rounds x £12 bills x 6 days x 50 weeks = £450,000 revenue. We want to charge them with a reasonable price at £4,500 = 1% of the transaction fee. Now, the annual revenue estimation comes down to:

1 restaurant = £4,500
100 restaurants = £450,000
222 restaurants = £ 1 million
222,222 restaurants = £1 billion 

Statista shows that there are 26,265 restaurants in the UK (2019); 660,755 in the U.S (2018); around 1 million in the EU (2016); 21953 in Australia (2016); 8,499 in New Zealand (2017).

Product Pricing (Done)

Our product is charged based on your business revenue. We will charge 1% on top of the normal transaction fee. For a £300,000 restaurant business, we will charge you £3,000 a year. To help you set up with our equipment (at no cost), we will first charge a £1000 annual deposit which will be refunded to you at the end of the year, regardless of your usage. The deposit will help us set up your tablets and provide continuous daily support. We will take the service charge every 14 days. 

The financial data regarding your business will be erased every 3 months. It will only be used for the purpose of our service charge. We will not share our data to anyone outside our organisation. 











Product Launch Strategy (Done)

The possible deployment options we devised are venture capitalist share buy-out, stock option and crowdfunding platform and self-fund entrepreneurship. 

1.	Venture Capitalist Share Buy-Out 
This is considered the best option depending on the offer on table. If other tech companies see the potential of the application and copy our products, they will dominate the market faster than we do. This option is considered safe if done safely because we just need to sell the product and we don’t need any finance to support the business. If we maintain the project as a secret and we pitch the product to the VC, they are likely to negotiate for an offer because they don’t want the app idea and implementation to be given to the competitors. The VC we are looking for are major shareholders in payment transaction because they want to gain business traction in their own industry. We will want to pitch our product to companies such as Stripe, Adyen and PayPal. We will send an email to one company at a time because we don’t want to disclose the business details to all companies. 


2.	IPO – Initial Public Offering 
If we cannot attract VC for a buy-out, we will give 10% share of the company to a law firm to initiate an IPO. IPO means to trade a percentage of your company into the stock market. It will help raise capital and attracts businesses to run the company for us. 






3.	Self-Fund Entrepreneurship 
If both option 1 and 2 are unsuccessful, we will deploy the project through self-funding. We will hold the majority share of the company. It only takes 222 restaurants to make £1 million. However, in the long run, we will need a group of experts to lead the project. We are hoping to launch the app internationally. However, we would first want to push the product to the market in populous English-Speaking Countries because our system is written in the English Language. Namely, they are the UK, U.S, EU, Australia, and New Zealand. We will develop an email crawler and send all the emails in a second.
