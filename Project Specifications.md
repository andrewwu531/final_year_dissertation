# Project Significance

In the age of the skills economy, in which a increasingly porportion of people becomes an University graduate, we will inevitably observe a decline in supply in jobs such as waitering. This drastic phenomenal is more likely to be continued in developed countries such as the UK, U.S., EU, and Japan. 
Furthermore, many restaurant owners are in the pursue of cost-effective technological solutions that help them lower the business running and advertisement costs. 
To reflect both the future restaurant staff shortage and the cost factors for restaurant owners, an interesting tech project – Hi there! I’m your e-Waiter - has been pioneered, a web-app that restaurant customers can self-help themselves to order and pay for their food and drinks.
