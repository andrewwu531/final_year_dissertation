# Project Significance

In the age of the skills economy, in which an increasingly proportion of people becomes an University graduate, we will inevitably observe a decline in supply in jobs such as waitering. This drastic phenomenon is more likely to be continued in the aging developed countries such as the UK, U.S., EU, and Japan. 
Furthermore, many restaurant owners are in the pursue of cost-effective technological solutions that help them lower the business running and advertisement costs. 
To reflect both the future restaurant staff shortage and the cost factors for restaurant owners, an interesting tech project – Hi there! I’m your i-Waiter - has been pioneered, a web-app that restaurant customers can self-help themselves to order and pay for their food and drinks online. 


# Brief Project Outline

A brief mechanism of the app is followed. First, the customers will be guided by the staff waiter to scan a QR code on a table using their phone camera. They will then browse the food and drinks on the app, make sit-in orders, pay for their bills and tips, and send it to the kitchen.
